# .. envvar:: core_reset_facts
#
# If ``True``, Ansible will not add facts that are already present on a host to
# the dictionary, and only store those specified in inventory.

# --------------
#   Core facts
# --------------

# .. envvar:: core_ansible_controllers
#
# List of IP addresses or CIDR subnets which contain hosts that are used to
# execute Ansible playbooks. Other roles that maintain host security can source
# the ``ansible_local.core.ansible_controllers`` list and add the entries found
# there to IP address whitelist.
core_ansible_controllers: []


# .. envvar:: core_uuid_random
#
# Ansible will try and read the UUID value from the host using ``dmidecode``.
# If it's not available, this value will be used as the UUID source.

# -------------------
#   Directory paths
# -------------------

# .. envvar:: core_root_facts
#
# Path where Ansible local facts are stored. This shouldn't really be changed
# because many Ansible roles use this path explicitly. This variable is set here
# so that it can be used by the directory creation task to ensure that the
# ``facts.d`` directory is present.
core_root_facts: '/etc/ansible/facts.d'


# .. envvar:: core_root_bin
#
# Directory where user binaries accessible via ``$PATH`` should be stored.
core_root_bin: '/usr/local/bin'


# .. envvar:: core_root_etc
#
# Directory where additional configuration files not related to existing
# services will be stored. Very rarely used.
core_root_etc: '/usr/local/etc'


# .. envvar:: core_root_lib
#
# Directory where various scripts which don't or shouldn't be directly
# accessible from the interactive shell should be stored, so that they don't
# pollute Tab-completion. Roles can create subdirectories here in case when
# more than a handful of scripts is used.
core_root_lib: '/usr/local/lib'


# .. envvar:: core_root_sbin
#
# Directory where administrator binaries accessible via ``$PATH`` should be
# stored.
core_root_sbin: '/usr/local/sbin'


# .. envvar:: core_root_share
#
# Path where static data files should be stored, similar to ``/usr/share``.
# Rarely used.
core_root_share: '/usr/local/share'


# .. envvar:: core_root_src
#
# Path where application sources (tarballs, ``git`` repositories) can be stored
# and operated on, usually in a separate subdirectory for each role or user.
core_root_src: '/usr/local/src'


# .. envvar:: core_root_data
#
# Directory that stores application data, things served by a given hosts, for
# example webpages. Web application system accounts may have their home
# directories there, as well as ``sftpusers`` websites and home directories.
core_root_data: '/srv'


# .. envvar:: core_root_srv
#
# Alternative directory for application data.
core_root_srv: '/srv'


# .. envvar:: core_root_backup
#
# Path where local backups generated by automated scripts are stored, usually
# in separate subdirectories for each user / role.
core_root_backup: '/var/backups'


# .. envvar:: core_root_var
#
# Path where variable internal data are stored. Examples include databases,
# spools, transient files. Usually a separate subdirectory is used, especially
# when application has its own home directory.
core_root_var: '/var/local'


# .. envvar:: core_root_home
#
# Path where home directories of local system accounts are stored (``/home`` is
# reserved for regular users and home directories of users stored in remote
# databases like LDAP).
core_root_home: '/var/local'


# .. envvar:: core_root_app
#
# Directory where non-web applications are installed. By default it's in
# a subdirectory, usually home directory of an application, but the root path
# might be different.
core_root_app: '/var/local'


# .. envvar:: core_root_log
#
# Path where log files are stored, optionally with a separate subdirectory.
core_root_log: '/var/log'


# .. envvar:: core_root_directories
#
# List of directories and their ``ansible_local.root.*`` variable names, passed
# to a task that creates them in the filesystem and the template that generates
# Ansible local facts.
